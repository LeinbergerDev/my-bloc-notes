      <p>Hello, I am Jason Leinberger.  I am currently a student at Bloc.
        Bloc offers online training for Software Development.  As of today I am three weeks
        into my program and I am loving it.  There were 3 tracks to chose from.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designer Track</li>
          <li>Part-Time Web Developer Track</li>
          <li>Software Developer Track</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course I chose the Software Developer Track.  Why did I chose this track?
          It's the longest and the most indepth track they offer.  I'll be learning a lot
          of new (or at least new to me) technologies.  Like probably all the other coding camps
          or even colleges this program starts with the fundamentals of HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript.
          I've done a little bit of HTML over the years so that's not too hard to pick up.  The CSS
          and the Javascript may be another story.  Anyway I've done the beginner stuff for all of them
          and I feel like I'm getting down.</p>

        <p>I created this site as a place for me to play with HTML5 CSS and Javascript.
          I fully expect this site to be broken half the time and being completely rewritten the rest of time.
          But since I'm really the only person who will see it I'm really not that bothered about that.</p>

        <p>Anyway there is a navigation bar (right now it's on the right side of the screen) that contains a
          mostly daily journal.  Take a look if you must.  But I warn you they are probably pretty ugly
          cause I'm really really new at this front end development stuff</p>
