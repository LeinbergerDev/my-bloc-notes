      <p>Today I worked on learning Javascript.  I learned:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>while loops</li>
        <li>for loops</li>
      </ol>
      <p>My assignment was to write Javascript that would plot the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall to the console.</p>
      <p>I completed this task fairly easily but I did make the mistake of not putting the line of code that reduces the number of beer bottles on the wall in the right location.
        indstead of the log reading 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
        It read Take it down and pass it around 99 bottles of beer on the wall.  I caught it before I turned it in which makes me happy.
        It would be pretty embarasing to have that kind of error in an asignment.</p>
        <p> It is 1:15 am so I am going to give up and go to bed for the night.</p>
